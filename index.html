            In the relatively short history of machine learning, the subtle balance between engineering and theoretical
            progress has been proved
            critical at various stages. The most recent wave of AI has brought
            to the IR community powerful techniques, particularly for pattern
            recognition. While many benefits from the burst of ideas as numerous tasks become algorithmically feasible,
            the balance is tilting
            toward the application side. The existing theoretical tools in IR can
            no longer explain, guide, and justify the newly-established methodologies. With no choices, we have to bet
            our design on black-box
            mechanisms that we only empirically understand.
          </p>

          <p class="large text-muted">
            The consequences can be suffering: in stark contrast to how the IR industry has envisioned modern AI making life easier, 
            many are experiencing increased confusion and costs in data manipulation, model selection, monitoring, censoring, and decision making. 
            This reality is not surprising: without handy theoretical tools, we often lack principled knowledge of the pattern recognition model's expressivity, 
            optimization property, generalization guarantee, and our decision-making process has to rely on over-simplified assumptions and human judgments from time to time.

          </p>
          <p class="large text-muted">
            Facing all the challenges, we started researching advanced theoretical tools emerging from various domains that can potentially 
            resolve modern IR problems. We encountered many impactful ideas and made several independent publications emphasizing different pieces.
            Time is now to bring the community a systematic tutorial on how we successfully adapt those tools and make significant progress in understanding, 
            designing, and eventually productionize impactful IR systems. We emphasize systematicity because IR is a comprehensive discipline that touches 
            upon particular aspects of learning, causal inference analysis, interactive (online) decision-making, etc. 
            It thus requires systematic calibrations to render the actual usefulness of the imported theoretical tools to serve IR problems, 
            as they usually exhibit unique structures and definitions. Therefore, we plan this tutorial to systematically demonstrate our learning and 
            successful experience of using advanced theoretical tools for understanding and designing IR systems.

                                    There are two critical stages for designing and understanding pattern recognition models: 
                                    the pre-designing stage where we generate
                                    a comprehensive inductive bias for the model, and the post-training
                                    stage where we diagnose the model to understand why it behaves
                                    in certain ways. We wish to answer the following questions in order to build up the intuition:
                                  </p>
                                  <ol>
                                    <li>
                                      what the model is <strong>capable of expressing</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      what are the <strong>optimization properties</strong> of the model?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                      how the model may <strong>generalize</strong> to unseen data
                                    </li>

                                      why the model would perofrm in <strong>particular</strong> ways
                                    </li>

                                    However, for deep learning models these questions are incredibly challenging to answer. In this session,
                                    we introduce the recent works that provides prespectives to them leveraging the theoretical tools 
                                    such as <i>neural tagent kernel</i>, <i>implcit bias of GD</i>, <i>structural complexity</i>, <i>domain shift</i>, <i>spectral analysis</i>, and <i>gradient-based attribution.</i>

                              Modern IR systems intrinsically build on the understandings of
                              interaction between the information consumer and provider. The
                              <i>exploration-exploitation</i> dilemma thus stands out as a major challenge because there are explicit or implicit costs associated with
                              each interaction. Many are motivated to characterize the underlying dynamics using such as <i>bandits</i> and <i>reinforcement learning</i>
                              (RL). Setting the practicality issues aside, there are critical conceptual challenges 
                              unsettled for both approaches. Notably, there is model-based and model-free options for optimizing the policy in
                              each setting, and while many empirical comparisons have been
                              conducted, there is no rigorous conclusion on what conditions
                              bring the maximum performance out of each candidate. During
                              our investigation, we find the <i>optimal control</i> an extraordinary tool
                              and testbed for revealing the strength and weaknesses of many
                              solutions. On the other hand, some empirical studies have found
                              inferior performances from bandits and RL, though they are conceptually more suitable for the tasks. We reveal that this phenomenon
                              is caused by the robustness issue: compared with the static counterparts, online decision-making methods are much more sensitive to
                              the algorithmic uncertainty since they tend to accumulate during
                              the process. Therefore, we introduce the advanced theoretical tools
                              from robust optimization and present real-world examples of how
                              to use them to enhance the robustness of our design.
